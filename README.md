# Project Overview
The goal is to deliver an Inventory Management System for a Fortune 500 client from the ground up. The existing system for the client is not scalable and doesn't perform well under a heavy traffic load. Your team's goal is to deliver this time-sensitive, full-stack application with a modern React front-end communicating with a robust Express back-end; a full CRUD warehouse/inventory management system.  Utilized Git, GitHub, Jira and the Scrum methodology to manage task delegation & collaborative workflows, and Figma for design mockups.

Tools used to complete project: create-react-app, react-router-dom, Node, Express, MySQL, Knex, BEM/SASS, npm, Postman, and browser development tools.
